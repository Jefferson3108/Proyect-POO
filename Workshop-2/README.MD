# Workshop 2 progress#
<p>
In workshop two, we added new user stories, as well as two new classes and one more requirement.
</p>
<p>
We also created a UML diagram with the five classes analyzed to understand the relationships between them, their respective attributes, and the methods we want to implement in the application.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we defined the folder-level structure we will implement, including folders dedicated to the model, view, and controller. We placed files there with the names of each class and their respective functionalities. We also initialized the classes and added some methods to classes such as payment and user.
