# Proyect Temu 

<p>
Our goal is to create a prototype of the Temu application following the concepts of object-oriented thinking with elements such as requirements, user stories, mockups and CRC cards.
</p>
### Requirements
This section seeks to find those objectives and functionalities proposed for the development of the application through functional and non-functional requirements.
### User Stories
Its purpose is to model and establish those functionalities for the application, in a clear manner and with a simple language understood by both the designer and the end user.
### Mockups
It is the part that gives us a graphical perspective of the interfaces required for the operation of the application, providing the user with a vision of the final product.
###CRC Cards
It allows you to identify those functionalities and characteristics of the application in order to classify them through objects and classes where they have behaviors and attributes in common. In addition, it looks for the relationship between the different classes and how they collaborate with each other.
